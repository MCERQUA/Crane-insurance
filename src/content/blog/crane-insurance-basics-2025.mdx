Operating a crane comes with significant risks and responsibilities. Whether you're a seasoned operator or new to the industry, understanding crane insurance is crucial for protecting your business, equipment, and livelihood.

## Why Crane Insurance is Essential

<Callout type="warning">
**Critical Coverage Gap**: Many general contractors' policies exclude crane operations, leaving operators exposed to millions in potential liability.
</Callout>

Crane operations involve unique risks that standard commercial insurance often doesn't cover:

- **High-value property damage** - A single mistake can cause millions in damage
- **Third-party liability** - Injuries to workers or the public
- **Equipment protection** - Cranes are expensive assets requiring specialized coverage
- **Riggers liability** - Coverage for property "on the hook"

### 1. General Liability Insurance

General liability forms the foundation of crane insurance coverage:

- **Bodily injury protection**: Medical expenses and legal costs for injured parties  
- **Property damage**: Covers damage to client property or public infrastructure
- **Legal defense**: Attorney fees and court costs

### 2. Riggers Liability Coverage

This specialized coverage protects property while it's being lifted:

- **"On the hook" protection**: Coverage for items being moved by the crane

### 3. Equipment Physical Damage

Protects your crane investment:

- **Comprehensive coverage**: Fire, theft, vandalism, weather damage

### What's the difference between general liability and riggers liability?

The key distinction involves property control:

- **Operations**: Types of lifts and job complexity

- **Location**: State regulations and regional risks

### Can I get insurance with past claims or violations?

Yes, but expect higher premiums. Insurance companies may:

- Mandate additional safety programs
- Exclude certain types of work
- Offer coverage through surplus lines markets

- **Coverage Coordination**: Eliminates gaps between policies
- **Claims Efficiency**: Streamlined claims process

However, specialized carriers may offer better coverage for specific needs.

### When should I review my crane insurance coverage?

- **Annually**: Before renewal to ensure adequate limits
- **After Major Purchases**: When adding new equipment
- **Contract Changes**: When taking on larger projects
- **After Claims**: To address coverage gaps
- **Business Growth**: As revenue or operations expand
- **Regulatory Changes**: When laws or requirements update
