When your crane hoists a $500,000 generator onto a rooftop or positions delicate manufacturing equipment worth millions, standard general liability insurance leaves a critical gap in your protection. The expensive equipment "on the hook"—the very items you're paid to move safely—remains uninsured under traditional policies, exposing you to potentially devastating financial losses.

Riggers liability insurance fills this crucial coverage gap, protecting crane operators and rigging professionals from claims involving damage to client-owned property during lifting operations. This comprehensive guide explores everything you need to know about riggers liability coverage, from understanding policy structures to selecting adequate limits for your specific operations.

## Understanding Riggers Liability Insurance: The Essential Protection Gap

Riggers liability insurance addresses one of the most significant exclusions in standard commercial general liability policies: damage to property in your "care, custody, or control." When you're lifting, moving, or positioning equipment that belongs to your clients, traditional insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for that property.

### What Riggers Liability Insurance Covers

**Property "On the Hook"**: Riggers liability insurance specifically covers client-owned property while it's under your control during lifting operations. This includes equipment being lifted, positioned, installed, or moved using cranes, hoists, or other rigging equipment.

**Real-World Coverage Scenarios**:
- HVAC units worth $100,000+ being positioned on rooftops
- Generators valued at $500,000 during installation processes
- Manufacturing machinery during factory setup and positioning
- Telecommunications equipment during tower installations
- Construction materials and prefabricated components during placement

### The Critical Gap in General Liability Coverage

Standard commercial general liability policies contain specific exclusions for property in your care, custody, or control. This means:

**What General Liability DOES Cover**:
- Third-party property damage caused by your operations
- Bodily injury to others during crane operations  
- Damage to surrounding structures or vehicles
- Legal defense costs for covered claims

**What General Liability DOESN'T Cover**:
- The piano you're lifting that gets damaged during the operation
- The generator that's damaged while being positioned
- Manufacturing equipment damaged during installation
- Any client-owned property under your operational control

> **Critical Example**: If your crane strikes a building while lifting a generator, general liability covers the building damage. However, if the generator is damaged during the lift due to rigging failure, only riggers liability insurance covers the generator's replacement cost.

## Types of Riggers Liability Coverage

Understanding the different ways to obtain riggers liability protection helps you select the most appropriate coverage structure for your operations.
