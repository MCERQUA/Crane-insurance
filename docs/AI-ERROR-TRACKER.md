# AI Error Tracker - Crane Insurance Project

## Overview
This document tracks all AI-encountered errors, their resolution patterns, and prevention strategies for the Heavy Crane Insurance project.

## Error Categories

### 1. Deployment Failures
**Pattern**: Local builds succeed but Netlify deployments fail
**Root Causes**:
- CRLF line endings (Windows/WSL compatibility)
- Missing component imports
- MDX parsing errors
- Environment variable differences

**Prevention Protocol**:
```bash
# Mandatory pre-deployment testing
node scripts/pre-deploy-check.js    # Environment validation
npm run test:mdx                    # MDX file validation
npm run test:netlify               # Netlify simulation
```

### 2. MDX Parsing Errors  
**Pattern**: Acorn parsing failures with JSX components
**Root Causes**:
- Malformed JSX syntax
- Component import failures  
- Content-level corruption
- Line ending inconsistencies

**Solution Strategy**: Template-based rebuilds using proven working structure

### 3. Component Import Failures
**Pattern**: Components fail to import during build
**Root Causes**:
- File path mismatches
- Missing component definitions
- TypeScript type conflicts

**Prevention**: Import validation before deployment

### 4. CSS Inheritance Issues
**Pattern**: Button text colors inherited from parent elements
**Established Solution**: Use `!important` prefix (`!text-white`, `!text-gray-900`)
**Status**: Resolved pattern

### 5. String Method Errors  
**Pattern**: Calling string methods on undefined values
**Prevention Pattern**:
```typescript
if (typeof input === 'string') {
  return input.replace('pattern', 'replacement')
}
```

## Resolution Workflows

### Standard Issue Resolution Process
1. **Initialize Tracking**: Use `/track-error [number]` command
2. **Document Thoroughly**: Problem, steps to reproduce, environment
3. **Apply Systematic Analysis**: Try established patterns first
4. **Document Each Attempt**: Track what was tried and results
5. **Update on Resolution**: Document final solution and root cause
6. **Extract Prevention**: Identify how to prevent similar issues

### Emergency Escalation Protocol
**Trigger**: 3 failed resolution attempts on any issue
**Action**: Automatic Slack notification to team channels
- #CCA-CRANE-INS-ERROR-updates-feed
- #echo-updates-feed (C0943NFUBDF)

### Command Integration
The following commands integrate with this tracking system:
- `/track-error [number]` - Initialize comprehensive error tracking
- `/new-issue [number]` - Quick issue initialization with template
- `/log-resolution [number]` - Log resolution attempts
- `/slack-alert [number]` - Post status updates to Slack

## Historical Patterns

### Successful Solution Patterns

#### Two-Step Fix Methodology
1. **Runtime Safety**: Prevent crashes with null/undefined checks
2. **Type Safety**: Maintain TypeScript contracts
**Success Rate**: High reliability in preventing deployment failures

#### Template-Based MDX Rebuilds
**Context**: When MDX acorn parsing errors persist despite structural fixes
**Solution**: Complete rebuild using working blog template structure
**Key Insight**: Content-level corruption requires rebuild, not incremental debugging

## Prevention Strategies

### Development Workflow
1. Always run comprehensive test suite before deployment
2. Use established solution patterns from this tracker
3. Document new issues immediately when encountered
4. Apply runtime safety checks in all code changes
5. Validate component imports before committing

### Testing Protocol
- **Required Tests**: All tests must pass before deployment claims
- **MDX Validation**: Specific testing for content parsing
- **Environment Simulation**: Match production environment exactly
- **Component Validation**: Verify all imports are accessible

## Learning Archive

### Project-Specific Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Astro 4.x with TypeScript, Tailwind v3, React 19
- **Common Failure Points**: MDX parsing, component imports, CSS inheritance
- **Deployment Platform**: Netlify with forms integration
- **Critical Files**: BaseLayout.astro (SEO), componentRegistry.ts (tracking)

### Development Context
- **Business Domain**: Crane insurance specialization
- **Content Strategy**: Educational blog posts, service descriptions
- **SEO Focus**: Comprehensive schema markup and technical optimization
- **User Experience**: Mobile-first responsive design

## Metrics

### Issue Resolution Stats
- **Average Resolution Time**: TBD (tracking needed)
- **First-Attempt Success Rate**: TBD (tracking needed)  
- **Escalation Rate**: TBD (tracking needed)
- **Prevention Effectiveness**: TBD (tracking needed)

### Common Issue Frequency
*Data will be populated as issues are encountered and tracked*

## System Integration

### Error Tracking Commands
All error tracking integrates with:
1. **Local Tracking**: `.claude/error-tracking/issue-[number].md`
2. **Global Documentation**: This file (`docs/AI-ERROR-TRACKER.md`)
3. **Slack Integration**: Automatic updates to team channels
4. **Project Memory**: `/echo-memory` command for pattern access

### Workflow Integration
- **Before Changes**: Check this tracker for similar issues
- **During Development**: Use tracking commands for any problems
- **After Resolution**: Document solution and prevention strategy
- **Regular Review**: Update patterns and prevention strategies

---

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement tracking for deployment readiness metrics
- [ ] Create automated testing integration with error tracking
- [ ] Establish performance benchmarks for issue resolution
- [ ] Build pattern recognition system for common error types

*This tracker is continuously updated as new issues are encountered and resolved. It serves as the knowledge base for preventing recurring problems and improving development efficiency.*
