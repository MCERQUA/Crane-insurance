## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How much crane insurance do I need?**
A: Coverage needs vary by operation size and risk exposure. Most operators need $1-5 million in general liability, plus riggers liability coverage equal to the maximum value of loads typically handled. Equipment physical damage should reflect current replacement costs.

**Q: What is riggers liability and do I need it?**
A: Riggers liability covers damage to property while it's "on the hook" - being lifted, moved, or positioned by your crane. This coverage is essential since general liability typically excludes damage to property in your care, custody, or control.

**Q: Are there different requirements for different types of cranes?**
A: Yes, requirements often vary by crane type, capacity, and operating environment. Tower cranes, mobile cranes, and overhead cranes may have different insurance and bonding requirements depending on local regulations.

**Q: How can I reduce my crane insurance costs?**
A: Focus on safety training, proper equipment maintenance, choosing experienced operators, implementing loss prevention programs, and working with insurers who specialize in crane operations.

**Q: What should I do if I have a crane accident?**
A: Immediately ensure safety of all personnel, contact emergency services if needed, document the scene thoroughly, notify your insurance carrier within 24 hours, and preserve all evidence until your adjuster arrives.
